      "(\"Are Idle Hands the Devil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Workshop?\\n\\nIncapacitation, Concentration, and Juvenile Crime\\n\\nBy BRIAN A. JACOB AND LARS LEFGREN*\\n\\nThis paper examines the short-term effect of school on juvenile crime. To do so, we\\nbring together daily measures of criminal activity and detailed school calendar\\ninformation from 29 jurisdictions across the country, and utilize the plausibly\\nexogenous variation generated by teacher in-service days. We \\xef\\xac\\x81nd that the level of\\nproperty crime committed by juveniles decreases by 14 percent on days when school\\nis in session, but the level of violent crime increases by 28 percent on such days. Our\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81ndings suggest\\nthat both incapacitation and concentration in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence juvenile\\ncrime. (JEL I0, I2, H4)\\n\\nJuvenile crime touches millions of people in\\nthe United States each year, imposing substan-\\ntial costs on society. In 1997, law enforcement\\nof\\xef\\xac\\x81cials arrested 2.8 million people under the\\nage of 18, accounting for one in \\xef\\xac\\x81ve of all\\narrests that year. Juveniles are twice as likely as\\nadults to be victims of serious violent crime and\\nthree times as likely to be victims of assault\\n(Howard Snyder and Melissa Sickmund, 1999).\\nEconomists estimate that expenditures on crim-\\ninal justice and private protection draw $175\\nbillion away from other productive uses each\\nyear (David Anderson, 1999). From the per-\\nspective of the juvenile, incarceration is associ-\\nated with a 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9330-percent decrease in earnings\\n(Jeffrey Grogger, 1992, 1995; Joel Waldfogel,\\n1994a, b; Richard B.

Any remaining errors are our own. The data used\\nin this study is available at the AER Web site: http://\\nwww.aeaweb.org/aer/contents/. The complete set of NIBRS\\ndata is available through the Inter-University Consortium of\\nPolitical and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of\\nMichigan (www.icpsr.umich.edu).\\n\\nFor these reasons, researchers have long sought\\nto better understand the determinants of juvenile\\ncrime. Studies have suggested a variety of factors\\nrelated to juvenile crime, including age (Alfred\\nBlumstein et al., 1986), gender (James Q. Wilson\\nand Richard Hernstein, 1985), family background\\n(H. Naci Mocan and Daniel Rees, 1999; Steven D.\\nLevitt and Lance Lochner, 2001), parenting qual-\\nity (P. K. Daag, 1991; Robert Sampson and John\\nLaub, 1993), economic opportunities (Grogger,\\n1998; Lochner, 1999), and the severity of punish-\\nment (Levitt, 1998). Yet the factors underlying\\njuvenile crime patterns and trends remain largely\\nunexplained (Levitt and Lochner, 2001).\\n\\nIt is often suggested that one way to reduce\\njuvenile crime is to lengthen the school day or\\nschool year and/or to provide activities for\\nyoung people when school is not in session. The\\nimplicit notion behind such program-oriented\\nsolutions to juvenile crime is a belief in the\\nimportance of incapacitation\\xe2\\x80\\x94that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidle hands\\nare the devil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workshop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that keeping kids\\nbusy will keep them out of trouble. Advocates\\nof after-school and other youth programs fre-\\nquently claim that juvenile violence peaks in the\\nafter-school hours on school days and in the\\nevenings on nonschool days. Indeed, as we can\\nsee in Figure 1, violent crime does in fact follow\\nthis pattern.1\\n\\nWhile the intuition behind such policy pre-\\nthe actual short-term\\n\\nscriptions is sensible,\\n\\n1 Snyder and Sickmund (1999) \\xef\\xac\\x81rst documented this\\npattern using 1991\\xe2\\x80\\x931994 National Incident-Based Report-\\ning System (NIBRS) data.\\n\\n1560\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 93 NO. 5\\n\\nJACOB AND LEFGREN: THE EFFECT OF SCHOOL ON JUVENILE CRIME\\n\\n1561\\n\\neffect of school or youth activities on juvenile\\ncrime is far from clear. First, there is no de\\xef\\xac\\x81n-\\nitive evidence on the causal impact of youth\\nprograms on crime (Lawrence W. Sherman,\\n1997). Second,\\nthe studies of the timing of\\njuvenile crime tend to look within the day, but\\ndo not address the level of crime across days.\\nImplicitly, proponents of after-school program\\nbelieve that lengthening the school day would\\nlower crime during the afternoon without in-\\ncreasing violence during other periods. Finally,\\nthese studies do not consider property crimes or\\nother nonviolent crimes.\\n\\nIn this paper, we carefully examine the rela-\\ntionship between school and juvenile crime.\\nThis effort will not only help us to better un-\\nderstand the determinants of juvenile delin-\\nquency, but also provide some insight regarding\\nthe potential impacts of policy initiatives such\\nas lengthening the school day/year or introduc-\\ning new youth activities. Note that when we\\nrefer to the effect of school, we mean a short-\\nrun effect that is likely driven by day-to-day\\nchanges in the desire and opportunity to commit\\ncrime. We do not examine the longer-term im-\\npact of educational attainment on criminal ac-\\ntivity that may operate through changes in the\\nreturns to legitimate work, the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial or psy-\\nchic rewards of crime, or preferences. There is\\na relatively well-developed literature on this\\nlatter topic. See, for example, Lochner (1999)\\nand Lochner and Enrico Moretti (2001).\\n\\nTo do so, we bring together data on schooling\\nand criminal activity from a number of cities\\nand towns across the United States. To measure\\ncriminal activity, we use daily-level reports of\\ncriminal incidents, victimizations, and arrests\\nfor 29 jurisdictions from 1995 to 1999 collected\\nby the Bureau of Justice Statistics and compiled\\nin the NIBRS. To this crime data, we merge\\nschool calendar data for each year collected\\nfrom the school districts within each reporting\\njurisdiction. The school calendar data provide\\nprecise information on when school is in session\\nand the reason that students do not have school\\n(e.g., summer, school break, national holiday,\\nor teacher in-service training), allowing us to\\nexploit\\nthe considerable variation in school\\nterms across cities and over time.\\n\\nThe primary dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culty in estimating the effect\\nof school on crime is that school days are not\\nrandomly distributed across the year. Crime\\nmay be systematically higher or lower on days\\n\\nwhen school is not in session for a variety of\\nunrelated reasons. For example, there is evi-\\ndence that violent crime increases with temper-\\nature and on weekends (Craig Anderson et al.,\\n2000; Jacob and Lefgren, 2002). We address\\nthis by focusing on the variation generated by\\nteacher in-service days\\xe2\\x80\\x94 days on which stu-\\ndents do not attend school that teachers use for\\nprofessional development or planning purposes.\\nWe argue that these days are extremely unlikely\\nto be correlated with any factors in\\xef\\xac\\x82uencing the\\nlevel of criminal activity. By including a series\\nof \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects for city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year and day\\nof the week, we account for other unobservable\\ntime- and location-speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c factors that may be\\ncorrelated with school and juvenile crime.\\n\\nWe \\xef\\xac\\x81nd that the level of property crime com-\\nmitted by juveniles decreases by roughly 14 per-\\ncent on days when school is in session. In contrast,\\nwe \\xef\\xac\\x81nd that the level of violent criminal offenses\\namong juveniles increases by roughly 28 percent\\non school days. We \\xef\\xac\\x81nd little evidence that crime\\nchanges on the days immediately before or after\\nschool closings, suggesting that the changes in\\ncrime are not simply a result of substitution across\\ndays. Several facts suggest that the apparent per-\\nverse effect of school on violence is not simply\\ndue to heightened reporting by school personnel.\\nIndependent data from the National Crime Vic-\\ntimization Survey (NCVS) indicates that crimes\\noccurring at school are actually less likely to be\\nreported than those occurring elsewhere. The es-\\ntimates for aggravated assault\\xe2\\x80\\x94a serious violent\\ncrime that is more likely to be reported regardless\\nof the time or location of occurrence\\xe2\\x80\\x94are close to\\nthose for simple assault.2\\n\\nThis analysis provides some valuable insight\\ninto the nature and motivation of juvenile crime.\\nIn particular, it con\\xef\\xac\\x81rms that when juveniles are\\nnot provided with a supervised environment,\\nthey are likely to engage in antisocial behavior\\nthat manifests itself in increased property crime.\\nHowever, it also suggests that the degree of\\ninteraction among youth plays a signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant role\\nin the level of juvenile violence, highlighting\\nthe potentially volatile nature of juvenile inter-\\nactions and the social nature of juvenile violent\\ncrime.\\n\\n2 Ideally, we would like to look at very serious crimes\\nsuch as murder and rape. These crimes are extremely rare,\\nhowever, making it impossible to estimate the effect of\\nschool on these incidents with precision.\\n\\n\\x0c1562\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nThis analysis also has several implications\\nfor policy. First, it seems clear that policies that\\nintroduce after-school programs, lengthen the\\nschool year, or provide other programs for\\nyoung people will help mitigate the number of\\nproperty and other opportunistic crimes com-\\nmitted by juveniles. However, our results sug-\\ngest that such policies have important trade-offs\\nin relation to personal or violent crime. Because\\nthey increase the concentration of young people\\nin certain locations, they run the risk of raising\\nthe number of altercations that turn violent. It is\\nimportant to note that the absolute magnitude of\\nthe effects are small\\xe2\\x80\\x94 our estimates suggest\\nthat lengthening the school year by one day will\\nlead to a decrease of 0.29 property crimes and\\nan increase of 0.25 violent crimes in a city with\\na population of 120,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even though the rel-\\native (percent) effects are sizeable. Nonetheless,\\nthese \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings suggest policy makers might con-\\nsider designing smaller, neighborhood-based\\nprograms that\\nincorporate con\\xef\\xac\\x82ict resolution\\ncomponents or otherwise carefully structure the\\ninteractions.\\n\\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as\\nfollows. Section I presents a conceptual frame-\\nwork for understanding and identifying the\\nschool-crime relationship. Section II describes\\nthe data used in this analysis. Section III pre-\\nsents the results and Section IV concludes.\\n\\nI. Understanding and Identifying the School-\\n\\nCrime Relationship\\n\\nA. Conceptual Framework\\n\\nleast\\n\\nThere are at\\n\\nthree channels through\\nwhich school might in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence juvenile crime in\\nthe short-run. The implicit assumption behind\\nproposals that seek to mitigate juvenile crime by\\ninstituting after-school or other youth programs\\nis that school has an incapacitation effect\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\nis, it serves to keep kids busy and off the streets.\\nIn this view, by engaging students in structured\\nactivities and monitoring them, school will de-\\nter adolescents from committing crime.3 At the\\nsame time, however, school increases the geo-\\ngraphic concentration of\\nthereby\\n\\njuveniles,\\n\\nincreasing the number of potentially volatile\\ninteractions among youth. To the extent that\\njuvenile violent crime is at least partly a func-\\ntion of the number of such interactions, school\\nmight be expected to raise the level of juvenile\\nviolent crime. Note that this concentration ef-\\nfect need not manifest itself only during the\\nschool day or on school property. One might\\nimagine two students getting into an altercation\\nduring school and then \\xe2\\x80\\x9csettling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it after school\\nor later that evening in a nearby park or differ-\\nent neighborhood. While the incapacitation ef-\\nfect will in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence property as well as violent\\ncrime, the concentration effect will only impact\\nviolent crime. Finally, school may facilitate the\\ncoordination of crime among juveniles. That is,\\nthe increased concentration of juveniles may\\ndecrease the cost of planning crimes, which\\nmay in turn increase the observed level of ju-\\nvenile crime. While this coordination effect is\\nlikely to apply to both property and violent\\ncrime, we do not \\xef\\xac\\x81nd evidence of it below, and\\nthus focus our discussion on the incapacitation\\nand concentration effects.4\\n\\nThis framework suggests that one must (a)\\nconsider violent and property crime separately,\\nand (b) clearly distinguish between the timing\\nand the level of crime. The fact that violent\\ncrime rates spike in the late afternoon on school\\ndays does not imply that the absence of school\\nincreases crime, but may simply re\\xef\\xac\\x82ect the ef-\\nfect of school on the timing of violence within\\nthe day. The reasoning above implies that\\nschool will indeed decrease property crimes but\\nmay actually increase violent crime. Because\\nwe examine the daily incidence of crime as\\nopposed to the timing of crime (on which pre-\\nvious research has focused), we are able to test\\nthese implications.\\n\\nNote that this framework can be applied to\\nschooling changes on the extensive margin\\n(e.g., increasing the number of school days dur-\\ning the year by shortening the summer break) as\\nwell as the intensive margin (e.g., increasing the\\nlength of the school day by instituting an after-\\nschool program). It is also worth noting that\\n\\n3 Note that this argument does not make any claims\\nabout the long-term value of schooling itself. Any activity\\nthat engages and monitors youth might have the same\\nincapacitation effect.\\n\\n4 Coordination necessarily implies that two or more of-\\nfenders are involved in the commission of a crime. If school\\nwere important for the coordination of crimes, we would\\nexpect for school to have a more positive (less negative)\\neffect on the incidence of crimes with multiple offenders. In\\nSection III, we see that this is not the case.\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 93 NO. 5\\n\\nJACOB AND LEFGREN: THE EFFECT OF SCHOOL ON JUVENILE CRIME\\n\\n1563\\n\\nschool days could be more violent than non-\\nschool days even if increasing the duration of\\nthe school day reduces crime on the margin.\\nThe intuition here can also be used to better\\nunderstand the potential effects of other youth\\nprograms, activities, or neighborhood amenities\\n(e.g., parks, recreation centers, midnight basket-\\nball games). To the extent that these opportuni-\\nties attract a number of juveniles to the same\\nlocation, they will increase the number of inter-\\nactions between youth, thereby raising the po-\\ntential number of con\\xef\\xac\\x82icts and violent incidents.\\n\\nB. Identi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation Strategy\\n\\nWe are interested in examining the impact of\\nschool on juvenile crime, a relationship that can\\nbe captured by the following simple equation:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nJuvenileCrimedmyc\\n\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xbd \\xe2\\x90\\xa3\\xe2\\xab\\xb9 \\xe2\\x90\\xa6\\xe5\\x85\\xb1NoSchooldmyc\\xe5\\x85\\xb2 \\xe2\\xab\\xb9 \\xe2\\x90\\xa7dmyc\\n\\nwhere JuvenileCrime is a measure of criminal\\nactivity on day d, in month m and year y, in city\\nc, and NoSchool is a binary variable that takes\\non a value of one when school is not in session\\nand zero otherwise.\\n\\nit\\n\\nIf the variable NoSchool is uncorrelated with\\nthe error term in equation (1), then \\xe2\\x90\\xa6 provides an\\nunbiased estimate. However,\\nis likely that\\nschool days share certain unobservable character-\\nistics that are correlated with the level of criminal\\nactivity. Saturday, for example, is typically not a\\nschool day. Insofar as more people are out shop-\\nping and at social events on weekends, the bene-\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81ts of crime might be greater, which would tend to\\nbias our estimates upwards. This is true for the\\nsummer days as well since crime rates typically\\nrise with the temperature (Anderson et al., 2000;\\nJacob and Lefgren, 2002). Summer may also be\\natypical in that it is a time that families frequently\\ngo on vacation\\xe2\\x80\\x94changing the scope and venue of\\njuvenile criminal activity.\\n\\nWe address these endogeneity concerns by ex-\\nploiting variation in the school term generated by\\nteacher in-service days. These are days that stu-\\ndents do not attend school and that teachers use for\\nprofessional development,\\nteacher conventions,\\nplanning, or parent-teacher conferences. Table\\n1 illustrates the distribution of teacher in-service\\ndays by city. The \\xef\\xac\\x81rst row shows the average\\n\\nacross all in-service days in all cities and years.\\nWe see that districts have an average of 3.67\\nin-service days per year, although some have as\\nfew as one and others have as many as eight in any\\ngiven year. Nearly 50 percent of in-service days\\noccur on Fridays, with Mondays and Thursdays\\nbeing the next most common days. Half of the\\nin-service days take place from September to No-\\nvember, with the other half equally distributed\\nacross the winter and spring months.\\n\\nWhile the purpose of in-service is to provide\\nteachers with time to focus on administrative or\\nprofessional tasks, districts occasionally schedule\\nthese days to coincide with school holidays (per-\\nhaps to provide a longer break for students and\\nteachers). For example, some districts schedule\\nin-service days on the Wednesday before Thanks-\\ngiving, or the Friday before President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day. Be-\\ncause one might be concerned that juvenile crime\\nwould be different on such days for unrelated\\nreasons, we exclude these in-service days from\\nour main analysis. More speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally, we exclude\\nin-service days that fall within seven days of a\\nholiday observed by the district or on a holiday\\nobserved by other districts (e.g., some districts\\nhold in-service days on Veteran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day). Such days\\nare reclassi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed as breaks. In addition, we classify\\nearly release in-service days as half-days, but not\\nin-service days. We do so because the structure of\\nschool tends to be very different on half-days (e.g.,\\nthese days are often reserved for assemblies or\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81eld trips), making it dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult to interpret the ef-\\nfects of crime on half-days.5 We later show that\\nour results are not particularly sensitive to these\\nspeci\\xef\\xac\\x81cation choices.\\n\\nThe second row in Table 1 shows the average\\nfor the remaining in-service days in all cities and\\nyears, referred to as the analysis sample. While the\\naverage number of days drops by roughly 1.5, the\\ndistribution of in-service days across day of the\\nweek and season is roughly the same. It is clear\\nthat there is considerable variation across cities\\nand over time in the number of in-service days.6\\n\\n5 These days also occur most frequently at the start and\\n\\nend of school and before breaks and holidays.\\n\\n6 Note that Westminster, CO has no in-service days in\\nthis sample, due to the fact its fall in-services are generally\\na half-day and its spring in-services are generally the Friday\\npreceding MLK and/or President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day.

We de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne idio-\\nsyncratic breaks as those nonschool vacation\\ndays that fewer than 30 percent of the districts\\nhave off and common breaks as those days\\nthat at least 30 percent of the districts have off.

The day-of-week dum-\\nmies account for the fact that criminal activity\\nmay be greater, for example, on Fridays than on\\nMondays.8\\n\\n7 This subsumes all factors that do not vary within a\\ngiven month and district. Note that in our sample there\\nare not multiple school districts within a NIBRS juris-\\ndiction.\\n\\n8 Saturdays and Sundays to not contribute to the identi-\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81cation of our in-service coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient. We keep these days in\\nthe sample because (a) it is necessary in order to examine\\nthe displacement issue and (b) because some readers may be\\ninterested in seeing how juvenile crime varies from week-\\ndays to weekends.\\n\\nC. Temporal Displacement\\n\\nEven if our results are driven by exogenous\\nvariation in school attendance, it is possible that\\nschool is not changing the level of criminal activ-\\nity in aggregate, but merely shifting the time of\\noccurrence. For example, a juvenile who is plan-\\nning to steal something from the neighborhood\\nstore may \\xef\\xac\\x81nd it more convenient to do so on a\\nday that he has off from school. Similarly, the\\nyouth planning to take revenge on a rival may\\nchoose to do so on a school day because he knows\\nthe other youth will be nearby or because he wants\\nothers to witness the attack. In both cases, our\\nestimates of the school-crime relationship would\\nnot capture changes in the total amount of crime\\nover a longer period.\\n\\nWe adopt two strategies to examine whether\\nschool is merely displacing juvenile crime. First,\\nwe examine the level of juvenile crime on the days\\njust before and just after school breaks, holidays,\\nand teacher in-service days. If juveniles simply\\nsaved all of their grudges, vendettas, and other\\nviolent acts for days when school was in session,\\none might expect there to be unusually high levels\\nof crime on the days just before or after school\\nwas not in session to compensate for the unusually\\nlow levels of violent crime on nonschool days.\\nSecond, we replicate our analysis using weeks as\\nthe unit of analysis rather than days. If teacher\\nin-service days merely caused adolescents to shift\\nthe timing of criminal activity, we would not ex-\\npect the relationship between in-service days and\\nweekly crime to be much smaller (or nonexistent)\\nthan the relationship observed using daily crime\\nmeasures. As discussed in Section III, subsection\\nA, we \\xef\\xac\\x81nd no evidence that juvenile violent crime\\nis displaced and weak evidence that juvenile prop-\\nerty crime may be displaced partially, although\\nschool still appears to have an aggregate effect.9\\n\\n9 Theoretically, one might extend this second strategy to\\nexamine the effect of the total number of school days in a\\nyear on the crime during that year. However, it is quite\\ndif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult to \\xef\\xac\\x81nd suf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient exogenous variation in the length\\nof the school year to provide precise estimation with this\\nstrategy. Almost all school districts have school in session\\nfor roughly 180 days per year. Moreover, the factors that\\nin\\xef\\xac\\x82uence the length of the school year in practice such as\\nadverse weather conditions (e.g., snow days) may have an\\nindependent effect on the incidence of crime. Teacher\\nstrikes provide another potential source of useful variation,\\nbut are so rare (and limited to a select subset of districts)\\nthat they cannot be used to generate precise estimates.\\n\\n\\x0c1566\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nII. Data\\n\\nThis analysis requires a unique combination\\nof detailed information on schooling and crim-\\ninal activity. For information on criminal activ-\\nity, we rely on the data provided in the NIBRS.\\nNIBRS data is crucial for our analysis since it is\\nthe only (to our knowledge) large-scale data set\\nthat provides information on reported crimes\\nand arrests on a daily basis. The NIBRS data is\\nattractive for a number of other reasons as well.\\nFirst, the age of the victim and offender are\\nreported. This allows us to focus on crimes\\ncommitted by and against juveniles. Second, the\\ndata set reports the nature of the crime. Thus we\\ncan examine the effect of school attendance on\\ndifferent types of crime. Third, the data set\\nreports the time and location of crimes. With\\nthis information we are able to investigate the\\neffect of schooling on the time and venue of\\ncriminal activity in addition to its level. Finally,\\nNIBRS contains information on enough juris-\\ndictions to lend statistical power to the analysis.\\nThe primary disadvantage of NIBRS is that it\\nonly includes information on jurisdictions that\\nhave agreed to participate in the system, unlike\\nthe Uniform Crime Reports, a monthly compi-\\nlation of criminal activity collected by the FBI\\nto which all law enforcement agencies through-\\nout the country report.\\n\\nFor the purpose of our study, we chose partic-\\nipating cities with the largest populations. We\\nfocus on cities because rural NIBRS jurisdictions\\nare likely to be served by multiple school districts.\\nThe choice of large jurisdictions maximizes the\\npower of our estimates and facilitated the collec-\\ntion of school calendar data.10 We ultimately\\nended up with 29 jurisdictions because the vast\\nmajority of participating NIBRS jurisdictions are\\nextremely small towns or rural/suburban jurisdic-\\ntions.11 We drop roughly 2.6 percent (about 1,000\\n\\ncity-days) of the observations due to missing or\\nincorrectly reported crime data.\\n\\nWhile our sample is by no means represen-\\ntative of the nation, Table 1 shows that it does\\ninclude a reasonably diverse collection of juris-\\ndictions. Indeed, the period white, black, His-\\npanic, and Asian in our sample cities is virtually\\nidentical to the nation as a whole. The same is\\ntrue in terms of the fraction of single-parent\\nhouseholds and the fraction of the population\\naged 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9319. Moreover, the cities in our sample\\nare spread throughout the country, with one-\\nquarter to one-third of the sample coming from\\nthe South, Midwest, and West.12\\n\\nTo obtain information on schooling, we\\nmerge the NIBRS data with detailed school\\ncalendar data that we obtained by calling indi-\\nvidual school districts. The school calendars\\nprovide precise information on the days that\\nstudents have off from school and the reason\\n(e.g., summer break, national holiday, teacher\\nin-service training, etc.). This not only allows us\\nto minimize measurement error, but also to ex-\\nploit the considerable variation in school calen-\\ndars across cities and over time within a city.\\n\\nA. Measures of Criminal Activity\\n\\nHaving described our data sources, it is im-\\nportant to describe our measures of criminal\\nactivity. As noted above, NIBRS provides in-\\nformation on both incidents and arrests. The\\nprimary advantage of arrest data for our pur-\\nposes is that it allows one to determine the\\noffender age with certainty. However, because\\nnot all incidents result in an arrest, this data will\\ntend to understate the true level of criminal\\nactivity and provide much less information for\\nour estimation. In order to maximize the power\\nof our analysis, we use incident data in our main\\n\\n10 Because we include city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects,\\ncities with extremely small populations and therefore a low\\nincidence of crime contribute very little to the estimation.\\n11 Of the 2,852 jurisdictions that participated in NIBRS\\nin 1999, 34 percent represented county and state police\\nagencies. Of the remaining jurisdictions (city and town\\npolice departments), only 1.5 percent (28 jurisdictions) had\\nover 100,000 inhabitants. Only 45 jurisdictions had between\\n50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. Seventy-four percent of\\njurisdictions had fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. The fact\\nthat most participating jurisdictions are quite small re\\xef\\xac\\x82ects\\n\\nthe fact that there are many more small towns than large\\ncities nationally.\\n\\n12 It is worth noting that the fact that our sample is not\\nnationally representative will not affect the internal validity\\nof the estimates. The use of city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects\\nimplies that all identi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation is being achieved by high\\nfrequency variation within a school district. As in all such\\ncases, the external validity of the estimates depends on the\\nsimilarity between the analysis sample and the sample to\\nwhich one would like to make an inference. Because of the\\ndiversity of our sample, we believe that inferences can be\\nmade to most cities in the United States.\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 93 NO. 5\\n\\nJACOB AND LEFGREN: THE EFFECT OF SCHOOL ON JUVENILE CRIME\\n\\n1567\\n\\nspeci\\xef\\xac\\x81cations, including all incidents for which\\nit is possible to identify the age of the offender.\\nTo test the sensitivity of our results to non-\\nrandomly missing or inaccurate age information,\\nwe replicate the analysis using arrests\\xe2\\x80\\x94where\\nthe offender age in known with certainty\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\nobtain comparable results (see Table 6). In ad-\\ndition, we estimate models similar to equation\\n(2) but with the outcome variable being the\\nfraction of reported incidents with no informa-\\ntion on offender age, and \\xef\\xac\\x81nd neither statisti-\\ncally signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant nor substantively important\\nrelationships between teacher in-service day,\\nschool breaks, or summer vacation and the frac-\\ntion of data that is missing offender age. Finally,\\nto access the accuracy of offender age informa-\\ntion, we compare the reported age to the actual\\nage for the sample of incidents that resulted in\\nan arrest. We \\xef\\xac\\x81nd the correlation between re-\\nported offender age and actual arrestee age is\\nroughly 0.97 and, of all of the offenders who\\nwere reported as juveniles (ages 5 to 17) by\\nvictims or witnesses, less than 3 percent were in\\nfact 18 years or older (at the time of the inci-\\ndent) based on the arrest records.13 We defer the\\ndiscussion of a \\xef\\xac\\x81nal concern\\xe2\\x80\\x94reporting bi-\\nas\\xe2\\x80\\x94to Section III, subsection B.\\n\\nB. The Four \\xe2\\x80\\x9cW\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Juvenile Crime\\n\\nit\\n\\nis useful\\n\\nIn seeking to understand the determinants of\\nto examine who\\njuvenile crime,\\ncommits juvenile crime, what crimes juveniles\\nmost often commit, and where and when juve-\\nnile crimes occur. In our sample, juvenile of-\\nfenders are most likely to be white, male, and\\nbetween 15 and 17 years of age. The victims of\\njuvenile violent crime are generally other juve-\\nniles, with only one-quarter of victims over the\\nage of 24. Among serious offenses (as de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned\\nby NIBRS), the most common crimes commit-\\nted by juveniles are shoplifting, simple assault,\\nand vandalism, which account for nearly half of\\nall crimes committed by juveniles. Larceny,\\ndrug violations, burglary, aggravated assault,\\nand motor vehicle theft account for an addi-\\ntional 30 percent of juvenile crime. Very serious\\nviolent crimes such as rape and murder account\\nfor a tiny proportion of juvenile crime (less than\\n\\n13 For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see the\\n\\nearlier version of this paper (Jacob and Lefgren, 2003).\\n\\n1 percent of serious offenses). Not surprisingly,\\nthe vast majority of reported juvenile crime\\ntakes place outside of school. On school days,\\nhowever, roughly 7 percent of thefts, 11 percent\\nof vandalism, and 25 percent of assaults and\\ndrug use incidents do take place in school.14\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the timing of juvenile crime\\non school and nonschool days. We see that on\\nschool days, violent crime peaks at around\\n3 p.m., around the time that school gets out. The\\nrate then declines steadily through the evening\\nuntil midnight.15 On nonschool days, violent\\ncrime rises gradually until the afternoon and\\nthen plateaus until after midnight. The timing of\\nproperty crime appears similar on school and non-\\nschool days, with the incidence of crime rising\\ngradually until early evening and then declining.\\n\\nC. Estimation Strategy\\n\\nFrom an econometric standpoint, it is impor-\\ntant to use an estimation strategy that takes into\\naccount the nature of the data. While the sim-\\nplest strategy is to estimate ordinary least-\\nsquares (OLS) models using the number of\\ncriminal incidents/offenders, this strategy has\\nseveral problems. Because criminal incidents\\nare positively skewed, it is common to trans-\\nform the data using logs or log rates. However,\\nbecause we are using daily data for individual\\ncities and we are differentiating between adult\\nand juvenile crime, there are a nontrivial num-\\nber of zeros in the data\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly when we\\nfocus on individual crime categories\\xe2\\x80\\x94 compli-\\ncating the use of log crime rates. In order to\\naddress these concerns, we estimate a negative\\nbinomial regression model (William H. Greene,\\n2000). The negative binomial model is a gener-\\nalization of the Poisson regression model that\\nallows for the variance of the outcome measure\\nto differ from the mean, making it appropriate\\nfor count data with overdispersion. In order to\\naccommodate the city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year effects in\\nour model, we use the \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects negative\\n\\n14 For a more detailed description of juvenile crime,\\n\\nalong with tables, see Jacob and Lefgren (2003).\\n\\n15 The level of crime around midnight is somewhat in-\\n\\xef\\xac\\x82ated because of a tendency for law enforcement agencies\\nto list midnight as the time of occurrence for a dispropor-\\ntionate number of crimes occurring from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.\\nWe thank Howard Snyder for bringing this point to our\\nattention.\\n\\n\\x0c1568\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nFIGURE 1.

The means are computed\\nusing the daily incidence of crime divided by the population for all of the city-days in our sample, excluding Saturdays and\\nSundays. The standard error of the mean is in parentheses. The standard errors are cluster-corrected to account for the fact\\nthat observations within a city are not independent.\\n\\n100,000 residents on school and nonschool\\nweekdays. For property crime, there is only a\\nsmall difference between juvenile crime rates\\non school versus nonschool days (3.5 versus\\n3.8). If we focus on our cleanest comparison\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nbetween teacher in-service days and school\\ndays\\xe2\\x80\\x94juvenile property crime seems to be sub-\\nstantially higher when school is not in session\\n(3.5 versus 4.4). In contrast, the juvenile violent\\ncrime rate appears to be substantially lower on\\nnonschool days. Hence, the simple comparison\\nof means suggests that school may reduce juve-\\nnile property crime, but actually increase juve-\\nnile violent crime.\\n\\nOne might be concerned, however, that other\\ndistrict- or time-speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c factors could be driving\\nthis apparent relationship between school and\\ncrime. For example, school districts that schedule\\nmany teacher in-service days may differ system-\\natically from other school districts, or the sched-\\nuling of breaks or in-service days may take place\\nduring times of the year, or days of the week that\\ntend to have low (or high) crime. The following\\nmodels attempt to control for such factors.\\n\\nTable 3 shows the results of negative bino-\\nmial regressions in which the dependent vari-\\nable is\\nreported juvenile\\noffenders. All regressions include a \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects\\n\\nthe number of\\n\\nfor the day of the week and city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects to account for static (or even\\nslowly changing) differences between districts\\nas well as changes in criminal activity due to the\\ntime of year or day of the week.\\n\\nIf we consider all crimes together, there does\\nnot appear to be a strong or convincing relation-\\nship between school and crime. In fact, the point\\nestimate for teacher in-service days is essentially\\nzero. When we consider violent and property\\ncrimes separately, however, a quite different pic-\\nture emerges. The coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients suggest that the\\nlevel of juvenile property crimes is about 13\\npercent higher on teacher in-service days, sug-\\ngesting that school decreases juvenile property\\ncrime. In contrast, the point estimates indicate\\nthat juvenile violent crime is roughly 32 percent\\nlower on teacher in-service days, evidence that\\nschool actually increases juvenile violent crime.\\nExponentiating the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients to obtain exact\\neffects suggests that in-service days are associ-\\nated with 14 percent more property crime and\\n28 percent less violent crime.16 As mentioned\\n\\n16 As noted in the introduction, while the relative effects\\nare substantial, because the level of juvenile crime on any\\nparticular day is low, the absolute magnitude of these effects\\n\\n\\x0c1570\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nTABLE 3\\xe2\\x80\\x94THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPORTED JUVENILE OFFENDERS AND THE SCHOOL TERM\\n\\n(Dependent variable \\xe2\\xab\\xbd number of reported juvenile offenders\\n\\nfor the following offenses)\\n\\nSerious offenses\\n\\nAll\\n\\ncrimes\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.007\\n(0.16)\\n0.032\\n(1.02)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.112\\n(4.31)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.268\\n(10.63)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.018\\n(0.89)\\n0.172\\n(3.27)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.007\\n(0.52)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.028\\n(2.03)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.040\\n(2.84)\\n0.054\\n(3.94)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.071\\n(5.06)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.294\\n(19.69)\\n\\nYes\\n\\nProperty\\ncrimes\\n\\n0.133\\n(2.78)\\n0.154\\n(4.17)\\n0.021\\n(0.71)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.179\\n(6.05)\\n0.068\\n(2.90)\\n0.156\\n(2.36)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.039\\n(2.29)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.060\\n(3.54)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.061\\n(3.60)\\n0.019\\n(1.16)\\n0.029\\n(1.74)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.243\\n(13.65)\\n\\nYes\\n\\nViolent\\ncrimes\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.323\\n(4.40)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.204\\n(3.94)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.478\\n(10.00)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.418\\n(9.85)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.220\\n(6.52)\\n0.101\\n(1.28)\\n0.046\\n(2.15)\\n0.045\\n(2.07)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.011\\n(0.52)\\n0.052\\n(2.39)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.374\\n(15.60)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.416\\n(17.15)\\n\\nYes\\n\\nOther\\ncrimes\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.106\\n(1.07)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.089\\n(1.13)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.353\\n(5.18)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.343\\n(5.47)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.105\\n(2.60)\\n0.159\\n(1.20)\\n0.078\\n(2.29)\\n0.031\\n(0.89)\\n0.038\\n(1.12)\\n0.206\\n(6.17)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.108\\n(3.05)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.302\\n(8.09)\\nYes\\n\\nMinor\\noffenses\\n\\nAll\\n\\ncrimes\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.153\\n(2.57)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.079\\n(1.77)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.271\\n(6.90)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.388\\n(10.30)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.128\\n(4.33)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.126\\n(1.43)\\n0.073\\n(3.69)\\n0.043\\n(2.15)\\n0.023\\n(1.14)\\n0.170\\n(8.71)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.052\\n(2.55)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.212\\n(9.97)\\nYes\\n\\n38,339\\n\\n38,339\\n\\n38,308\\n\\n37,181\\n\\n37,451\\n\\nIndependent variables\\n\\nTeacher in-service day\\n\\nIdiosyncratic break\\n\\nCommon break\\n\\nHoliday\\n\\nSummer vacation\\n\\nHalf-day\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nCity \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year\\nand day-of-week\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects\\n\\nObservations\\n\\nNotes: The estimates come from negative binomial regressions.

However,\\nthis effect is not statistically signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant at conven-\\ntional levels.18 The \\xef\\xac\\x81nal column examines minor\\noffenses, which include disorderly conduct, loiter-\\ning, and alcohol violations among others. The\\ncoef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient on teacher in-service suggests that\\nschool increases the incidence of these offenses\\nby roughly 15 percent. Insofar as many of these\\noffenses are most commonly committed in\\ngroups, these results are not surprising.\\n\\nThe other coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients provide some addi-\\ntional insight into the nature and patterns of\\njuvenile crime. Juvenile violent crime is sub-\\nstantially lower on holidays, common school\\nbreaks, and during the summer while juvenile\\nproperty crime only appears to decline on hol-\\nidays.19 Weekends are associated with much\\nless juvenile violent crime than other days of the\\nweek (opposite the adult pattern) and juvenile\\nproperty crime is less common on Sundays and\\nmidweek than other days.\\n\\nTable 4 presents similar estimates for in-\\n\\n18 The point estimate on idiosyncratic breaks is nearly\\nidentical, and when these variables are combined, the esti-\\nmates are marginally signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant.\\n\\n19 The lack of correlation between summer vacation and\\nproperty crime might be because students are more likely to\\nvacation with family or engage in other forms of summer\\nrecreation as opposed to committing crime. The small effect\\nis largely driven by the fact that summer vacation appears to\\nhave a minimal effect on shoplifting. The incidence of other\\nproperty crime, such as burglary, robbery, vandalism, and\\nvehicle theft does increase during summer vacation.\\n\\ndividual offenses separately. Among violent\\ncrimes, we see that school appears to have a\\nsimilar negative effect on both simple and aggra-\\nvated assaults, although the aggravated assault\\npoint estimates are less precisely estimated. With\\nthe exception of vehicle theft, the property crime\\nresults are all consistent with the general \\xef\\xac\\x81nding.\\nDrug violations appear to decrease when school is\\nout, though the effect is insigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cant. Curfew and\\nloitering violations increase by 22 percent on\\nteacher in-service days, but disorderly conduct\\namong juveniles decreases by 51 percent.\\n\\nA. Temporal Displacement\\n\\nit\\n\\nWhile the evidence above suggests that\\nin\\xef\\xac\\x82uences the prevalence of juvenile\\nschool\\ncrime on particular days,\\nis possible that\\nschool is merely causing juveniles to shift crime\\nto other days and therefore does not affect the\\naggregate level of crime. Table 5 provides some\\nevidence on this type of displacement. The top\\npanel shows the results of a model that includes\\nindicator variables for the three days immedi-\\nately preceding and the three days immediately\\nfollowing all nonschool days, in addition to all\\nof the other covariates included in earlier mod-\\nels. If displacement were important, we would\\nexpect the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients on the leads and/or lags\\nto be signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant and to take on the opposite sign\\nof the in-service variable. For violent crime, we\\nsee that while juvenile offenses decline by about\\n30 percent on teacher in-service days, that is no\\nsigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cant difference in the level of juvenile\\nviolence on the three days immediately before\\n\\n\\x0c1572\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nni\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly different from zero.20 This suggests\\nthat school does indeed increase the level, and\\nnot simply the timing, of violent crime. For\\nproperty crime, the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients on the lead and\\nlag variables bounce from negative to positive,\\nalthough none are statistically signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant. The\\nsum of the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients, however, is close to\\nzero and is not statistically different from zero.\\nThis is consistent with displacement of property\\ncrime over the course of a week, but the lack of\\nprecision makes it dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult\\nto draw strong\\nconclusions.\\n\\nTABLE 5\\xe2\\x80\\x94THE TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT OF JUVENILE\\n\\nCRIME ACROSS THE SCHOOL TERM\\n\\n(Dependent variable \\xe2\\xab\\xbd\\n\\nnumber of reported\\njuvenile offenders)\\n\\nProperty\\n\\ncrime\\n\\nViolent\\ncrime\\n\\n0.110\\n(2.17)\\n0.079\\n(1.51)\\n0.013\\n(0.24)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.092\\n(1.69)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.008\\n(0.15)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.065\\n(1.12)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.032\\n(0.61)\\n0.006\\n0.00\\n[0.96]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.305\\n(4.02)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.045\\n(0.65)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.014\\n(0.21)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.051\\n(0.78)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.102\\n(1.32)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.101\\n(1.26)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.079\\n(1.12)\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.697\\n16.11\\n[0.00]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n38,339\\n\\n38,308\\n\\n0.265\\n(1.76)\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\xe2\\xab\\xba0.561\\n(2.97)\\n\\nYes\\n\\n5,416\\n\\n5,416\\n\\nModel I\\n\\nTeacher in-service\\n\\n1 day preceding in-service\\n\\n2 days preceding in-service\\n\\n3 days preceding in-service\\n\\n1 day following in-service\\n\\n2 days following in-service\\n\\n3 days following in-service\\n\\nSum of coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients\\nTest that sum of\\n\\ncoef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients equals zero\\n[p-value]\\n\\nCity \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year and\\n\\nday-of-week \\xef\\xac\\x81xed\\neffects\\n\\nObservations (days)\\n\\nModel II\\n\\nFraction of the week\\n\\nconsisting of teacher\\nin-service days\\n\\nCity \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 year and\\n\\nday-of-week \\xef\\xac\\x81xed\\neffects\\n\\nObservations (weeks)\\n\\nThe bottom panel of Table 5 presents the\\nresults of a model in which we examine the\\neffect of in-service on crime aggregated over a\\nlonger time period in order to test for displace-\\nment. We sum the number of crimes over a\\nseven-day period centered on Friday (the modal\\nin-service day) and then use the same negative\\nbinomial regression framework to estimate the\\nrelationship between weekly crime and the frac-\\ntion of the week that was an in-service day.21\\nWe control for the fraction of the week com-\\nposed of summer vacation, holidays, idiosyn-\\ncratic and common breaks, and half-days as\\nwell as \\xef\\xac\\x81xed effects for city \\xe2\\xb4\\xb1 month.

Indeed, the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients for\\nthe leads and lags are all the same sign as the\\nin-service variable, and a chi-squared test indi-\\ncates that the sum of these coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients is sig-\\n\\n20 Note that the nonlinear nature of the model slightly\\ncomplicates the interpretation of the sum of coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients. It\\nmay be that the baseline rates of offending are different on\\nthe days preceding or following in-service. Thus the per-\\ncentage effects are not perfectly comparable for the lags and\\nleads of the in-service variable. This is not a problem with\\nlinear models (e.g., OLS), which give us the same results.\\nFurthermore, our examination of weekly crime rates that we\\nreport next is not affected by this concern.\\n\\n21 The negative binomial coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients represent approxi-\\nmate percentage effects. If we simply used the sum of\\nin-service days in a week as the dependent variable, we\\nwould expect a smaller coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient than our baseline results\\nbecause the same absolute effect of in-service days has a\\nsmaller percentage effect on weekly crime than on daily\\ncrime. Using the fraction of the week composed of in-\\nservice days accounts for this difference.\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 93 NO. 5\\n\\nJACOB AND LEFGREN: THE EFFECT OF SCHOOL ON JUVENILE CRIME\\n\\n1573\\n\\neffects are larger in absolute value than the\\ncorresponding one-day effects, suggesting that\\ntemporal displacement does not complicate the\\ninterpretation of our coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients. In sum, there\\nis no evidence of displacement in the case of\\nviolent crime and only weak evidence of dis-\\nplacement in the case of property crime.\\n\\nB. Sensitivity Analyses\\n\\nA serious concern in the preceding analysis\\ninvolves reporting bias. On one hand, juvenile\\ncrime may be more likely to be reported on\\nschool days because of greater supervision on\\nthe part of school personnel or greater vigilance\\nby law enforcement, which would lead us to\\noverstate the deleterious effects of school on\\nviolent crime. On the other hand, it is possible\\nthat crimes committed by juveniles in or\\naround school may be more likely to be han-\\ndled by school personnel and therefore not\\ncome to the attention of the police, in which\\ncase our violent crime estimates may actually\\nbe too low.22\\n\\nThe National Crime Victimization Survey\\n(NCVS) provides an excellent forum to inves-\\ntigate this concern. The NCVS is an annual,\\nnationally representative survey of\\nroughly\\n50,000 households conducted by the Bureau of\\nJustice Statistics in order to determine the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfre-\\nquency, characteristics, and consequences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\ncriminal victimization in the United States. The\\nNCVS collects detailed incident-level data\\nabout all reported and unreported criminal vic-\\ntimizations that allow one to determine, among\\nother things, the age of the victim(s) and of-\\nfender(s), the time and location of the offense,\\nthe type of crime(s) committed, and whether the\\ncrime was reported to law enforcement. Using\\nNCVS data on all victimizations committed by\\njuvenile offenders from 1992 to 2000, we \\xef\\xac\\x81nd\\nthat reporting rates are actually lower for crimes\\ncommitted at or near school. This is true not\\nonly for broad crime categories such as assault,\\ntheft, or robbery, but also for much more de-\\ntailed categorizations that distinguish offenses\\nby their severity (e.g., completed robberies with\\ninjury from serious assault, thefts of less than\\n\\n22 Reporting bias is unlikely to be a large concern with\\ncrimes such as shoplifting and vandalism, which constitute\\nthe bulk of juvenile property crimes.\\n\\n$10, simple assault completed without injury,\\nthreatened verbal assault, etc.).23\\n\\nWithin our analysis, another way to examine\\nthe possibility of reporting bias is to focus on\\nserious crimes that are more likely to be re-\\nported to authorities regardless of the time or\\nlocation of occurrence. Row 2 in Table 6 shows\\nthat\\nin-service days have approximately the\\nsame effect on aggravated assault (which is\\nsubstantially more likely to be reported than\\nsimple assault, the most common violent juve-\\nnile crime) as on all violent crime.24 Another\\nway to address the issue of reporting bias is to\\nexamine the timing or location of juvenile crime\\nwithin the school day. If school-related report-\\ning bias were driving the results, one would\\nexpect the effect to disappear if one looks only\\nat crimes that take place during nonschool hours\\nor crimes that take place outside of school.\\nWhen one looks only at crimes committed dur-\\ning nonschool hours (i.e., before 7 a.m. and\\nafter 3 p.m.) in row 3, the point estimates are\\nsomewhat smaller although the pattern of re-\\nsults remains the same and the violent crime\\nresults are still strongly signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant.

The Heterogeneity of Schooling Effects\\n\\nAcross Juvenile Offenders\\n\\nTable 7 examines whether the effects of\\nschool vary across juvenile offenders. Overall,\\nthe sign of the coef\\xef\\xac\\x81cients is invariant to race,\\nage, gender, and residence. Additionally, there\\nappear to be only minor differences in the mag-\\nnitude of effects across subgroups. The one\\nexception to this is that school appears to have\\nno effect on juvenile property crime for black\\n\\n\\x0c1576\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\\n\\nDECEMBER 2003\\n\\nyouth. At the risk of overinterpreting the data,\\nthese results suggest that the behavior of older\\noffenders is less sensitive to school, which\\ncould be the case if high-risk juveniles are more\\nlikely to drop out of school. Similarly, if high-\\nrisk juveniles are more likely to drop out in\\nlarger cities, we might also expect\\njuvenile\\ncrime in these cities to be less sensitive to\\nschool schedules than in other cities.\\n\\nIV. Conclusions\\n\\nIn summary, we \\xef\\xac\\x81nd that school appears to\\nreduce the incidence of juvenile property crime by\\nabout 15 percent, but increases the level of juve-\\nnile violent crime by nearly 30 percent. Our evi-\\ndence suggests that these effects are not driven by\\nreporting bias and do not simply re\\xef\\xac\\x82ect temporal\\ndisplacement. These \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings are consistent with a\\ntheoretical framework in which school provides\\nmonitoring, structure, and activities that reduce\\nproperty crime while at the same time increasing\\nthe level of\\ninteraction among adolescents,\\nthereby raising the likelihood of violent con\\xef\\xac\\x82icts.\\nOur estimates suggest that lengthening the\\nschool year by one day will lead to a decrease of\\n0.29 property crimes and an increase of 0.25\\nviolent crimes in a city with a population of\\nabout 120,000.27 Given the average reported\\nvalue of stolen or damaged property in our\\nsample of $1,088, the reduction of property\\ncrime would result in a savings of approxi-\\nmately $318. Using the cost of an assault of\\n$8,515 estimated by Ted Miller et al. (2001),\\nthe violence associated with having school in\\nsession another day costs about $2,170.28\\n\\nWhile this analysis is likely to be of minimal\\nimportance for determining the length of the\\nschool year or\\nsummer\\nschool,29 we believe that this analysis provides\\n\\nthe provision of\\n\\n27 This is calculated by the authors using estimates of the\\npercent effect of school on property and violent crimes that\\nare committed by at\\nleast one juvenile along with the\\naverage daily number of such offenses in our sample.\\n\\n28 This \\xef\\xac\\x81gure includes the direct costs of the offense\\n(e.g., medical care and forgone wages) as well as intangible\\ncosts such as pain and suffering. This does not take into\\naccount the costs associated with processing these incidents\\nthrough the criminal justice system, the effect of crime on\\nthe offender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taste for future criminal activity, or the effect\\nof school on unreported crime.\\n\\n29 Crime considerations are likely to be second order rela-\\ntive to the cost and bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts of providing schooling. In partic-\\n\\nsome valuable insight into the nature and moti-\\nvation of juvenile crime. Both incapacitation\\nand social interaction models appear to be im-\\nportant determinants of juvenile crime. Further-\\nmore, our \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings may have\\nsigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cant\\nrami\\xef\\xac\\x81cations for other youth activities that do\\nnot have an explicit educational component,\\nsuch as midnight basketball or other programs\\ndesigned primarily to keep youth busy and \\xe2\\x80\\x9coff\\nthe streets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The increased violence generated\\nby bringing together youth may more than off-\\nset any societal gains associated with reduced\\nproperty crime.30 In general, our \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings suggest\\nthat summer youth employment programs or\\nsmaller, neighborhood-based after-school pro-\\ngrams, that provide structured activities for ad-\\nolescents but do not substantially increase their\\nconcentration, may be the best way to reduce\\njuvenile crime.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst study that\\nlooks at the effect of school on the level as well\\nas the timing of juvenile crime. By highlighting\\nthe role of concentration as well as incapacita-\\ntion, we believe that\\nthe \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings presented\\nabove shed light on the nature of juvenile crime\\nand provide some guidance to those developing\\nprevention programs aimed at youth. Finally,\\nthe evidence provided in this paper underscores\\nthe importance of social interactions in analyz-\\ning individual outcomes.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAllison, Paul D. and Waterman, Richard P.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFixed-Effects Negative Binomial Models.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSociological Methodology, 2002, 32(1), pp.\\n247\\xe2\\x80\\x93 65.\\n\\nAnderson, Craig A.; Anderson, Kathryn B.; Dorr,\\n\\nular, according to the 2000 Census, about 20 percent of the\\nU.S. population is between the ages of 5 and 19.
